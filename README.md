# Predictive Modeling for Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Machine Learning
Summary
This project applies machine learning to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) cell-nuclei measurements. Using RStudio and a reproducible Quarto (.qmd) workflow, we explored a dataset of 569 samples with 30 features, performed exploratory data analysis, identified high-impact predictors, and developed multiple classification models.

We evaluated Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors, achieving up to 94.7% accuracy and 94.1% sensitivity, significantly reducing false negatives compared to traditional methods. The project concludes with a presentation summarizing methodology, feature selection, model comparison, and recommendations for real-world diagnostic deployment.
